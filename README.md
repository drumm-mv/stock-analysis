# Stock-analysis
Read through a list of stock quotes and return the total value as well as Return on investment percentage

## Overview of Project

### Purpose of Analysis
To expand upon the original requested script we will refactor the current code to increase processing speed. Although the current code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for substantially larger lists stocks; it may take a long time to execute.

## Results

### Conclusions for Refactoring Code
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary
In a summary statement, address the following questions.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code

|Advantages|Disadvantages|
| --- | --- |
|Removed redundancies and duplications<br>improve the effectiveness of the code|Imprecise refactoring could introduce<br>new bugs and errors into the code<br>|
|Improved legibility improves the<br>comprehensibility of the code for other<br>programmers|There is no clear definition of “neat code”<br>|
|Removed redundancies and duplications<br>improves the effectiveness of the code|The benefit is not self-evident;<br>Improved code difficult for user to recognize<br>when the functionality stays the same|

 - How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
